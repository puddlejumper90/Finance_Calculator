# Finance_Calculator
A command line calculator to help you with your basic finances

As of 3/18/2020, the application can be used via a basic python IDE.

This application will be able to calculate your current financial situation and help you get a good understanding ouf your current situation.

The application will keep a record of all of your queries in a file called "FC_Log.csv" in the application's current directory so you will be able to analyze any or all of your queries. This makes it easier for you to create various financial scenarios for yourself so that you will be able to plan ahead, for any situation.

When running the application, simply follow the instructions to enter a full query. The application will then show you all of your relevent data, then give you the option to either start a new database or add the current query to a new row. The database will be saved in a .csv file. Only create a new database once, unless you want to start fresh.
