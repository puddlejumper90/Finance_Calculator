A command-line calculator to help you with your basic finances

As of 3/18/2020, the application can be used via a basic python IDE.

This application is able to calculate and provide insights into your current personal financial situation.

The application will keep a record of all of your queries in a file called "FC_Log.csv", in the application's current directory. This .csv file will allow you to analyze your queries in your chosen spreadsheet application. The idea is to give you tools to create various financial scenarios for yourself so that you will be able to plan for any situation.

When running the application, simply follow the instructions to enter a full query. The application will then show you all of your relevant data. Once the application has finished running, it will either create the "FC_Log.csv" file in the application's current directory or add a new row to the log file. The application records to the log, who made the query, and at what time. It will also show you various calculations and recommendations.

This application will continue to become improved over time. Check back often to see if there are any new updates.
